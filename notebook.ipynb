      "<description lang=\"EN\" load-source=\"patent-office\" mxw-id=\"PDES67111512\"><?BRFSUM description=\"Brief Summary\" end=\"lead\"?><h4>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h4><p>The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for improving processor performance by reducing processing delays associated with branch instructions. In particular, the present invention provides an instruction cache for a super-scalar processor wherein branch-prediction information is provided within the instruction cache.</p><p>The time taken by a computing system to perform a particular application is determined by three basic factors, namely, the processor cycle time, the number of processor instructions required to perform the application, and the average number of processor cycles required to execute an instruction. Overall system performance can be improved by reducing one or more of these factors. For example, the average number of cycles required to perform an application can be significantly reduced by employing a multi-processor architecture, i.e., providing more than one processor to execute separate instructions concurrently.</p><p>There are disadvantages, however, associated with the implementation of a multi-processor architecture. In order to be effective, multi-processing requires an application that can be easily segmented into independent tasks to be performed concurrently by the different processors. The requirement for a readily segmented task limits the effective applicability of multi-processing. Further, the increase in processing performance attained via multi-processing in many circumstances may not offset the additional expense incurred by requiring multiple processors.</p><p>Single-processor hardware architectures that avoid the disadvantages associated with multi-processing have been proposed. These so called \"super-scalar\" processors permit a sustained execution rate of more than one instruction per processor cycle, as opposed to conventional scalar processors which--while capable of handling multiple instructions in different pipeline stages in one cycle--are limited to a maximum pipeline capacity of one instruction per cycle. In contrast, a super-scalar pipeline architecture achieves concurrency between instructions both in different pipeline stages and within the same pipeline stage.</p><p>A super-scalar processor that executes more than one instruction per cycle, however, can only be effective when instructions can be supplied at a sufficient rate. It is readily apparent that instruction fetching can be a limiting factor in overall system performance if the average rate of instruction fetching is less than the average rate of instruction execution. Providing the necessary instruction bandwidth for sequential instructions is relatively easy, as the instruction fetcher can simply fetch several instructions per cycle. It is much more difficult, however, to provide sufficient instruction bandwidth in the presence of non-sequential fetches caused by branches, as the branches make the instruction fetching dependent on the results of instruction execution. Thus, the instruction fetcher can either stall or fetch incorrect instructions when the outcome of a branch is not known.</p><p>For example, FIG. 1 illustrates two instruction runs consisting of a number of instructions occupying four instruction-cache blocks (assuming a four-word cache block) in an instruction cache memory. The first instruction run consists of instructions S1-S5 that contain a branch to a second instruction run T1-T4. FIG. 2 illustrates how these instruction runs are sequenced through a four-instruction decoder and a two-instruction decoder, assuming for purposes of illustration that two cycles are required to determine the outcome of a branch. As would be expected, the four-instruction decoder provides a higher instruction bandwidth than the two-instruction decoder, but neither provides sufficient instruction bandwidth for a super-scalar processor. As illustrated in FIG. 3, the instruction bandwidth improves dramatically if the branch delays are reduced to zero.</p><p>The dependency between the instruction fetcher and the execution unit caused by branches can be reduced by predicting the outcome of the branch during an instruction fetch without waiting for the execution unit to indicate whether or not the branch should be taken. Branch prediction relies heavily on the fact that the outcome of a branch does not change frequently over a given period of time. The instruction fetcher can predict future branch executions using information collected on the outcome of the previous branch executions performed by the execution unit.</p><p>A conventional method for hardware-branch prediction uses a branch target buffer to collect information about the most-recently executed branches. See, for example, \"Branch Prediction Strategies and Branch Target Buffer Design\", by J.K.F. Lee and A.J. Smith, IEEE Computer, Vol. 17, pp. 6-22, January, 1984. Typically, the branch target buffer is accessed using an instruction address, and indicates whether or not the instruction at that address is a branch instruction. If the instruction is a branch instruction, the branch target buffer indicates the predicted outcome and the target address.</p><p>The hit ratio of a branch target buffer, i.e., the probability that a branch is found in the branch target buffer at the time it is fetched, increases as the size of the branch target buffer increases. FIG. 4 is a graph of the hit ratio for a target branch buffer for selected sample benchmark programs, and illustrates the necessity of a relatively large branch target buffer in order to obtain an acceptable prediction accuracy. Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide an improved hardware branch prediction architecture that would require less hardware support as compared with a conventional branch target buffer.</p><h4>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h4><p>The present invention provides a super-scalar processor wherein branch-prediction information is provided within an instruction cache memory. Each instruction cache block stored in the instruction cache memory includes branch-prediction information fields in addition to instruction fields, which indicate the address of the instruction block's successor and information indicating the location of a branch instruction within the instruction block. Thus, the next cache block can be easily fetched without waiting on a decoder or execution unit to indicate the proper fetch action to be taken for correctly predicted branching.</p><p>More specifically, branch predication is accomplished in accordance with the present invention by loading a plurality of instruction blocks into the instruction cache memory, wherein each of the instruction blocks includes a plurality of instructions and instruction fetch information. The instruction fetch information includes an address tag, a branch block index and a successor index that includes a successor valid bit. A fetch program counter is used to generate and supply a fetch program counter value to the instruction cache memory in order to prefetch one of the plurality of instruction blocks stored in the instruction cache memory. The processor determines whether the successor valid bit of the prefetched instruction block is set to a predetermined condition which indicates that a branch instruction within the prefetched instruction block is predicted as taken. If the successor valid bit is not set to the predetermined condition, the fetch program counter value is incremented and supplied to the instruction cache memory to prefetch a succeeding instruction block. If the successor valid bit is set to the predetermined condition, a predicted target branch address is generated by the instruction cache memory based on information contained in the instruction fetch information field associated with the instruction block. The predicted target branch address and the branch location of the branch instruction within the instruction cache memory is then stored in a branch prediction memory. The branch instruction is subsequently executed with a branch execution unit which generates an actual branch location address and a target branch address for the executed branch instruction. The actual branch location and the target branch address are then respectively compared with the branch location and predicted target branch address stored in the branch prediction memory. A misprediction signal is generated if the compared values are not equal, and the successor valid bit and instruction fetch information are updated for the instruction block in response to misprediction signal.</p><p>The utilization of the instruction cache and branch prediction memory as described above, provides branch prediction accuracy substantially identical to that of a target branch buffer without requiring as much hardware support.</p><?BRFSUM description=\"Brief Summary\" end=\"tail\"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description=\"Brief Description of Drawings\" end=\"lead\"?><h4>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</h4><p>With the above as background, reference should now be made to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments in conjunction with the drawings, in which:</p><p>FIG. 1 shows a sequence of two instruction runs to illustrate decoder behavior;</p><p>FIG. 2 illustrates the sequencing of the instruction runs shown in FIG. 1 through a two-instruction and four-instruction decoder;</p><p>FIG. 3 illustrates the improvements in instruction bandwidth for the instruction runs illustrated in FIG. 2 if branch delays are avoided;</p><p>FIG. 4 is a graph of the hit ratio of a target branch buffer;</p><p>FIG. 5 illustrates a preferred layout for an instruction-cache entry in accordance with the present invention;</p><p>FIG. 6 an example of instruction-cache entries for the code sequence illustrated in FIG. 3;</p><p>FIG. 7 is a block diagram of a super-scalar processor according to the present invention;</p><p>FIG. 8 is a block diagram of an instruction cache employed in the super-scalar processor illustrated in FIG. 7;</p><p>FIG. 9 is a block diagram of a branch prediction FIFO employed in the super-scalar processor illustrated in FIG. 7; and</p><p>FIG. 10 block diagram of a branch execution unit employed in the super-scalar processor illustrated in FIG. 7.</p><?brief-description-of-drawings description=\"Brief Description of Drawings\" end=\"tail\"?><?DETDESC description=\"Detailed Description\" end=\"lead\"?><h4>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</h4><p>The basic operation of an instruction cache for a super-scalar processor in accordance with the present invention will be discussed with reference to FIG. 5, which illustrates a preferred layout for an instruction-cache entry required by the super-scalar processor. In the example illustrated, the cache entry holds four instructions and instruction fetch information which is shown in expanded form to include a conventional address tag field and two additional fields: a successor index field which indicates both the next entry predicted to be fetched and the first instruction within the next entry predicted to be executed, and a branch block index field which indicates the location of a branch point within the instruction block. The successor index field does not specify a full instruction address, but is of sufficient size to select any instruction address within the instruction cache. The successor index field includes a successor valid bit that indicates a branch is predicted to be taken when set, and that a branch is not predicted to be taken when cleared.</p><p>FIG. 6 illustrates instruction-cache entries for the code sequence shown in FIG. 3, assuming a 64 Kbyte direct-mapped cache and the indicated instruction address. When a cache entry is first loaded, the address tag is set and the successor valid bit is cleared. The default for a newly-loaded entry, therefore, is to predict that a branch is not taken and the next sequential instruction block is to be fetched. FIG. 6 also illustrates that a branch target program counter can be constructed at branch points by concatenating the successor index field of the instruction block where the branch occurs to the address tag of the successor instruction block.</p><p>The validity of instructions at the beginning of a current instruction block are preferably determined by the low-order bits of the successor index field in the preceding instruction block. The successor index of the preceding instruction block may point to any instruction within the current instruction block, and instructions up to this point in the current instruction block are not executed by the processor. The validity of instructions at the end of the block are determined by the branch block index, which indicates the point where a branch is predicted to be taken The branch block index is required by an instruction decoder to determine valid instructions, while cache entries are retrieved based on the successor index fields alone.</p><p>To check branch predictions, the processor keeps a list of predicted branches, stored in the order in which the branches are predicted, in a branch prediction FIFO associated with the instruction cache. Each entry on the list indicates the location of the branch in the instruction cache, which is identified by concatenating the successor index of the entry preceding the branching entry with the branch location index field. Each entry also contains a complete program-counter value for the target of the branch.</p><p>The processor executes all branches in their original program sequence with a branch execution unit, and compares information resulting from the execution of the branches with information at the head of the list of predicted branches. The following conditions must hold for a successful branch prediction. First, if the branch is taken, its location in the instruction cache must match the location of the next branch on the list contained in the branch prediction FIFO. This condition is required to detect a taken branch that was predicted to be not taken. Secondly, the predicted target address of the branch at the head of the list must match the next instruction address determined by executing the branch.</p><p>The second comparison is relevant only if the locations match, and is required primarily to detect a branch which was not taken that was predicted to be taken. However, as the predicted target address is based on the address tag of the successor block, this comparison also detects that cache replacement during execution has removed the original target entry. In addition, comparing program-counter values checks that indirect branches were properly predicted.</p><p>The branch is mispredicted if either or both of the above-described conditions does not hold. When a misprediction occurs, the appropriate cache entry must be fetched using the location of the branch determined by the execution unit. The successor valid bit and instruction fetch information for the incorrect instruction block must also be updated based on the misprediction to reflect the actual result of the execution of the branch. For example, the successor valid bit is cleared if a branch had been predicted as taken but was not taken, so that on the next fetch of the instruction block the branch will be predicted as not taken. Thus, the successor valid bit and instruction fetch information alway reflect the actual result of the previous execution of the branch instruction.</p><p>With the above as background, reference should now be made to FIG. 7 for a detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the invention. FIG. 7 illustrates a block diagram of a super-scalar processor that includes a bus interface unit (BIU) 10, an instruction cache 12, a branch prediction FIFO 14, an instruction decoder 16, a register file 18, a reorder buffer 20, a branch execution unit 22, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) 24, a shifter unit 30, a load unit 32 a store unit 33, and a data cache 34.</p><p>The reorder buffer 20 is managed as a FIFO. When an instruction is decoded by the instruction decoder 16, a corresponding entry is allocated in the reorder buffer 20. The result value of the decoded instruction is written into the allocated entry when the execution of the instruction is completed. The result value is then written into the register file 18 if there are no exceptions associated with the instruction. If the instruction is not complete when its associated entry reaches the head of the reorder buffer 20, the advancement of the reorder buffer 20 is halted until the instruction is completed, additional entries, however, can continue to be allocated. If there is an exception or branch misprediction, the entire contents of the reorder buffer 20 are discarded.</p><p>As illustrated in FIG. 8, the instruction cache 12 includes an instruction store array 36 which is a direct mapped instruction cache organized as 512 instruction blocks of four words each, a tag array 38 having 512 entries composed of a 19 bit tag and a single valid bit for the entire block, a dual ported successor array 40 having 512 entries composed of an 11 bit successor index and a successor valid bit which indicates when set that the successor index stored in the successor array . .340.!. .Iadd.40 .Iaddend.should be used to access the instruction store array 36, and indicates when cleared that no branch is predicted within the instruction block, a dual ported block status array 42 that contains a branch block indicator for each instruction block in the instruction cache 12 which indicates the last instruction predicted to be executed within a block, a fetch program counter (PC) 44 (including a PC latch 46, a MUX unit 48 and an incrementer (INC) 50) that generates a PC value that is used for prefetching the instruction stream from the instruction cache 12, an instruction fetch control unit 52 that controls the fetching of instructions from the instruction cache 12, the replacement of cache blocks on misses, and the reformatting of the successor array 40 and branch block array 42 on branches that are mispredicted, and an instruction register latch 54 which is loaded with the instructions to be provided to the instruction decoder 16.</p><p>The branch prediction FIFO 14 is used to maintain information related to every predicted branch within an instruction block.

As illustrated in FIG. 9, the branch prediction FIFO 14 is preferably implemented as a fixed array with a target PC FIFO and a branch location FIFO, incrementing read/write pointers 56 and 58, and also includes a target PC comparator 60 and a branch location comparator 62 which are respectively coupled to a branch location data bus (CPC) and a target PC data bus (TPC).

The reservation station 62 is a FIFO array which receives decoded instructions from the instruction decoder 16 and operand information from the register file 18 and reorder buffer 20 and holds this information until the decoded instruction is free from dependencies and the branch computation unit 64 is free to execute the instruction. The result bus interface 66 couples the branch execution unit 22 to the CPC bus and TPC bus, which in turn are coupled to the branch location comparator 62 and the target PC comparator 60 of the branch predication FIFO 14 as illustrated in FIG. 9.</p><p>In operation, the instruction cache 12 is loaded with instructions from an instruction memory via the BIU 10. The fetch PC 44 supplies a predicted fetch PC value to the instruction cache 12 in order to prefetch an instruction stream. As previously stated, the successor valid bit for each instruction block is cleared when the instruction block is first loaded into the instruction cache 12. Thus, when a given instruction block is first fetched from the instruction cache 12, any branch in the block is predicted as not taken. The prefetched instruction block is supplied to the instruction decoder 16 via the instruction decode latch 54. The predicted fetch PC is then incremented via the incrementer 50 and loaded back into the fetch PC latch 46 via the MUX unit 48. The resulting fetch PC is then supplied to the instruction cache 12 in order to fetch the next sequential instruction block in the instruction store.</p><p>The branch execution unit 22 processes any branch instruction contained in the first prefetched instruction block, and generates an actual PC value and target PC value for the executed branch instruction. Note, that if the branch is not taken on execution, the target PC value generated by the branch execution unit 22 will be the next sequential value after the actual PC value, i.e., the term \"target PC\" in this sense does not necessarily mean the target of an executed branch, but instead indicates the address of the next instruction block to be executed regardless of the branch results. The actual PC value and the target PC value are respectively supplied to the CPC bus and the TPC bus and loaded into the branch location comparator and the target PC comparator in the branch prediction FIFO.</p><p>Where a branch was predicted .Iadd.as .Iaddend.not taken but was taken on execution, the comparison of the actual PC value supplied by the branch instruction unit 22 with the branch location value supplied from the branch location FIFO of the branch prediction FIFO 14 will fail. The branch prediction FIFO 14 resets and generates a branch misprediction signal which is supplied to the instruction fetch control unit of the instruction cache 12. The target PC from the branch execution unit 22 is then loaded into the fetch PC latch 46 via the MUX unit 48 and the successor array is updated to set the successor valid bit under control of the instruction fetch control circuit 52. Thus, the branch will be predicted as taken on subsequent fetches of the instruction block.</p><p>When the successor valid bit is set indicating a branch is predicted as taken, the value of the fetch PC latch is loaded into the next available entry in the branch prediction FIFO. A reconstructed predicted fetch PC formed from the successor index and the tag field read out of the tag array is loaded via the MUX 48 into the fetch PC latch 46. This reconstructed fetch PC is supplied to the instruction store array 36 to fetch the next instruction and to the branch prediction FIFO. Thus, the branch prediction FIFO entry contains the branch location of the branch as well as the predicted target of the branch.</p><p>The branch execution unit 22 subsequently executes the branch instruction and generates an actual PC value and a target PC value which are supplied to the branch location comparator and the target PC comparator in the branch prediction FIFO. If the branch was predicted to be taken, the PC value generated by the branch execution unit 22 will always match the branch location loaded from the branch location FIFO. Three possible conditions, however, will result in the target PC value generated by the branch execution unit 22 not matching the target PC stored in the branch prediction FIFO 14: the branch was predicted as taken but was not taken in which case the successor valid bit must be cleared, the branch executed a subroutine return to an address which did not match the predicted address thereby requiring the successor index be updated, or cache replacement occurred prior to the execution of the branch instruction requiring the reloading of the instruction cache.</p><p>The principal hardware cost of the above-described branch prediction scheme is the increase in the cache size caused by the successor index and branch block index fields associated with each entry in the instruction cache.

      "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for improving processor performance by reducing processing delays associated with branch instructions. In particular, the present invention provides an instruction cache for a super-scalar processor wherein branch-prediction information is provided within the instruction cache.\n",
      "The time taken by a computing system to perform a particular application is determined by three basic factors, namely, the processor cycle time, the number of processor instructions required to perform the application, and the average number of processor cycles required to execute an instruction. Overall system performance can be improved by reducing one or more of these factors. For example, the average number of cycles required to perform an application can be significantly reduced by employing a multi-processor architecture, i.e., providing more than one processor to execute separate instructions concurrently.\n",
      "There are disadvantages, however, associated with the implementation of a multi-processor architecture. In order to be effective, multi-processing requires an application that can be easily segmented into independent tasks to be performed concurrently by the different processors. The requirement for a readily segmented task limits the effective applicability of multi-processing. Further, the increase in processing performance attained via multi-processing in many circumstances may not offset the additional expense incurred by requiring multiple processors.\n",
      "Single-processor hardware architectures that avoid the disadvantages associated with multi-processing have been proposed. These so called \"super-scalar\" processors permit a sustained execution rate of more than one instruction per processor cycle, as opposed to conventional scalar processors which--while capable of handling multiple instructions in different pipeline stages in one cycle--are limited to a maximum pipeline capacity of one instruction per cycle. In contrast, a super-scalar pipeline architecture achieves concurrency between instructions both in different pipeline stages and within the same pipeline stage.\n",
      "A super-scalar processor that executes more than one instruction per cycle, however, can only be effective when instructions can be supplied at a sufficient rate. It is readily apparent that instruction fetching can be a limiting factor in overall system performance if the average rate of instruction fetching is less than the average rate of instruction execution. Providing the necessary instruction bandwidth for sequential instructions is relatively easy, as the instruction fetcher can simply fetch several instructions per cycle. It is much more difficult, however, to provide sufficient instruction bandwidth in the presence of non-sequential fetches caused by branches, as the branches make the instruction fetching dependent on the results of instruction execution. Thus, the instruction fetcher can either stall or fetch incorrect instructions when the outcome of a branch is not known.\n",
      "For example, FIG. 1 illustrates two instruction runs consisting of a number of instructions occupying four instruction-cache blocks (assuming a four-word cache block) in an instruction cache memory. The first instruction run consists of instructions S1-S5 that contain a branch to a second instruction run T1-T4. FIG. 2 illustrates how these instruction runs are sequenced through a four-instruction decoder and a two-instruction decoder, assuming for purposes of illustration that two cycles are required to determine the outcome of a branch. As would be expected, the four-instruction decoder provides a higher instruction bandwidth than the two-instruction decoder, but neither provides sufficient instruction bandwidth for a super-scalar processor. As illustrated in FIG. 3, the instruction bandwidth improves dramatically if the branch delays are reduced to zero.\n",
      "The dependency between the instruction fetcher and the execution unit caused by branches can be reduced by predicting the outcome of the branch during an instruction fetch without waiting for the execution unit to indicate whether or not the branch should be taken. Branch prediction relies heavily on the fact that the outcome of a branch does not change frequently over a given period of time. The instruction fetcher can predict future branch executions using information collected on the outcome of the previous branch executions performed by the execution unit.\n",
      "A conventional method for hardware-branch prediction uses a branch target buffer to collect information about the most-recently executed branches. See, for example, \"Branch Prediction Strategies and Branch Target Buffer Design\", by J.K.F. Lee and A.J. Smith, IEEE Computer, Vol. 17, pp. 6-22, January, 1984. Typically, the branch target buffer is accessed using an instruction address, and indicates whether or not the instruction at that address is a branch instruction. If the instruction is a branch instruction, the branch target buffer indicates the predicted outcome and the target address.\n",
      "The hit ratio of a branch target buffer, i.e., the probability that a branch is found in the branch target buffer at the time it is fetched, increases as the size of the branch target buffer increases. FIG. 4 is a graph of the hit ratio for a target branch buffer for selected sample benchmark programs, and illustrates the necessity of a relatively large branch target buffer in order to obtain an acceptable prediction accuracy. Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide an improved hardware branch prediction architecture that would require less hardware support as compared with a conventional branch target buffer.\n",
      "SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "The present invention provides a super-scalar processor wherein branch-prediction information is provided within an instruction cache memory. Each instruction cache block stored in the instruction cache memory includes branch-prediction information fields in addition to instruction fields, which indicate the address of the instruction block's successor and information indicating the location of a branch instruction within the instruction block. Thus, the next cache block can be easily fetched without waiting on a decoder or execution unit to indicate the proper fetch action to be taken for correctly predicted branching.\n",
      "More specifically, branch predication is accomplished in accordance with the present invention by loading a plurality of instruction blocks into the instruction cache memory, wherein each of the instruction blocks includes a plurality of instructions and instruction fetch information. The instruction fetch information includes an address tag, a branch block index and a successor index that includes a successor valid bit. A fetch program counter is used to generate and supply a fetch program counter value to the instruction cache memory in order to prefetch one of the plurality of instruction blocks stored in the instruction cache memory. The processor determines whether the successor valid bit of the prefetched instruction block is set to a predetermined condition which indicates that a branch instruction within the prefetched instruction block is predicted as taken. If the successor valid bit is not set to the predetermined condition, the fetch program counter value is incremented and supplied to the instruction cache memory to prefetch a succeeding instruction block. If the successor valid bit is set to the predetermined condition, a predicted target branch address is generated by the instruction cache memory based on information contained in the instruction fetch information field associated with the instruction block. The predicted target branch address and the branch location of the branch instruction within the instruction cache memory is then stored in a branch prediction memory. The branch instruction is subsequently executed with a branch execution unit which generates an actual branch location address and a target branch address for the executed branch instruction. The actual branch location and the target branch address are then respectively compared with the branch location and predicted target branch address stored in the branch prediction memory. A misprediction signal is generated if the compared values are not equal, and the successor valid bit and instruction fetch information are updated for the instruction block in response to misprediction signal.\n",
      "The utilization of the instruction cache and branch prediction memory as described above, provides branch prediction accuracy substantially identical to that of a target branch buffer without requiring as much hardware support.\n",

      "FIG. 10 block diagram of a branch execution unit employed in the super-scalar processor illustrated in FIG. 7.\n",
      "DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n",
      "The basic operation of an instruction cache for a super-scalar processor in accordance with the present invention will be discussed with reference to FIG. 5, which illustrates a preferred layout for an instruction-cache entry required by the super-scalar processor. In the example illustrated, the cache entry holds four instructions and instruction fetch information which is shown in expanded form to include a conventional address tag field and two additional fields: a successor index field which indicates both the next entry predicted to be fetched and the first instruction within the next entry predicted to be executed, and a branch block index field which indicates the location of a branch point within the instruction block. The successor index field does not specify a full instruction address, but is of sufficient size to select any instruction address within the instruction cache. The successor index field includes a successor valid bit that indicates a branch is predicted to be taken when set, and that a branch is not predicted to be taken when cleared.\n",
      "FIG. 6 illustrates instruction-cache entries for the code sequence shown in FIG. 3, assuming a 64 Kbyte direct-mapped cache and the indicated instruction address. When a cache entry is first loaded, the address tag is set and the successor valid bit is cleared. The default for a newly-loaded entry, therefore, is to predict that a branch is not taken and the next sequential instruction block is to be fetched. FIG. 6 also illustrates that a branch target program counter can be constructed at branch points by concatenating the successor index field of the instruction block where the branch occurs to the address tag of the successor instruction block.\n",
      "The validity of instructions at the beginning of a current instruction block are preferably determined by the low-order bits of the successor index field in the preceding instruction block. The successor index of the preceding instruction block may point to any instruction within the current instruction block, and instructions up to this point in the current instruction block are not executed by the processor. The validity of instructions at the end of the block are determined by the branch block index, which indicates the point where a branch is predicted to be taken The branch block index is required by an instruction decoder to determine valid instructions, while cache entries are retrieved based on the successor index fields alone.\n",
      "To check branch predictions, the processor keeps a list of predicted branches, stored in the order in which the branches are predicted, in a branch prediction FIFO associated with the instruction cache. Each entry on the list indicates the location of the branch in the instruction cache, which is identified by concatenating the successor index of the entry preceding the branching entry with the branch location index field. Each entry also contains a complete program-counter value for the target of the branch.\n",
      "The processor executes all branches in their original program sequence with a branch execution unit, and compares information resulting from the execution of the branches with information at the head of the list of predicted branches. The following conditions must hold for a successful branch prediction. First, if the branch is taken, its location in the instruction cache must match the location of the next branch on the list contained in the branch prediction FIFO. This condition is required to detect a taken branch that was predicted to be not taken. Secondly, the predicted target address of the branch at the head of the list must match the next instruction address determined by executing the branch.\n",
      "The second comparison is relevant only if the locations match, and is required primarily to detect a branch which was not taken that was predicted to be taken. However, as the predicted target address is based on the address tag of the successor block, this comparison also detects that cache replacement during execution has removed the original target entry. In addition, comparing program-counter values checks that indirect branches were properly predicted.\n",
      "The branch is mispredicted if either or both of the above-described conditions does not hold. When a misprediction occurs, the appropriate cache entry must be fetched using the location of the branch determined by the execution unit. The successor valid bit and instruction fetch information for the incorrect instruction block must also be updated based on the misprediction to reflect the actual result of the execution of the branch. For example, the successor valid bit is cleared if a branch had been predicted as taken but was not taken, so that on the next fetch of the instruction block the branch will be predicted as not taken. Thus, the successor valid bit and instruction fetch information alway reflect the actual result of the previous execution of the branch instruction.\n",
      "With the above as background, reference should now be made to FIG. 7 for a detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the invention. FIG. 7 illustrates a block diagram of a super-scalar processor that includes a bus interface unit (BIU) 10, an instruction cache 12, a branch prediction FIFO 14, an instruction decoder 16, a register file 18, a reorder buffer 20, a branch execution unit 22, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) 24, a shifter unit 30, a load unit 32 a store unit 33, and a data cache 34.\n",
      "The reorder buffer 20 is managed as a FIFO. When an instruction is decoded by the instruction decoder 16, a corresponding entry is allocated in the reorder buffer 20. The result value of the decoded instruction is written into the allocated entry when the execution of the instruction is completed. The result value is then written into the register file 18 if there are no exceptions associated with the instruction. If the instruction is not complete when its associated entry reaches the head of the reorder buffer 20, the advancement of the reorder buffer 20 is halted until the instruction is completed, additional entries, however, can continue to be allocated. If there is an exception or branch misprediction, the entire contents of the reorder buffer 20 are discarded.\n",
      "As illustrated in FIG. 8, the instruction cache 12 includes an instruction store array 36 which is a direct mapped instruction cache organized as 512 instruction blocks of four words each, a tag array 38 having 512 entries composed of a 19 bit tag and a single valid bit for the entire block, a dual ported successor array 40 having 512 entries composed of an 11 bit successor index and a successor valid bit which indicates when set that the successor index stored in the successor array . .340.!. .Iadd.40 .Iaddend.should be used to access the instruction store array 36, and indicates when cleared that no branch is predicted within the instruction block, a dual ported block status array 42 that contains a branch block indicator for each instruction block in the instruction cache 12 which indicates the last instruction predicted to be executed within a block, a fetch program counter (PC) 44 (including a PC latch 46, a MUX unit 48 and an incrementer (INC) 50) that generates a PC value that is used for prefetching the instruction stream from the instruction cache 12, an instruction fetch control unit 52 that controls the fetching of instructions from the instruction cache 12, the replacement of cache blocks on misses, and the reformatting of the successor array 40 and branch block array 42 on branches that are mispredicted, and an instruction register latch 54 which is loaded with the instructions to be provided to the instruction decoder 16.\n",
      "The branch prediction FIFO 14 is used to maintain information related to every predicted branch within an instruction block.

The output signals generated by the target PC comparator 60 and the branch location PC comparator 62 are provided to a branch FIFO control circuit 63. The FIFO 14 could alternatively be implemented as a shiftable array or a circular FIFO.\n",
      "The branch execution unit 22 contains the hardware that actually executes the branch instructions and writes the branch results back to the reorder buffer 18 As shown in FIG. 10, the branch execution unit 22 includes a branch reservation station 62, a branch computation unit 64 and a result bus interface 66.

The result bus interface 66 couples the branch execution unit 22 to the CPC bus and TPC bus, which in turn are coupled to the branch location comparator 62 and the target PC comparator 60 of the branch predication FIFO 14 as illustrated in FIG. 9.\n",
